This is a copy of the community edition of OpenSplice DDS.
It is the version currently used by LSST developers.

The Release corresponding to the required version of the SAL
should be installed in the same directory as the SAL release.

OpenSpliceDDS directory contains the HDE for versions 6.4.1 and 6.9.0
V6.9.0 is the preferred default for use with ts_sal V3.9 onwards.


An environment variable, OSPL_HOME, must point to the subdirectory:
 ./OpenSpliceDDS/V6.9.0/HDE/x86_64.linux 
If this package is set up with eups, this environment variable is automatically set.

Note that there are firewall rules that must be modified to use DDS/Opensplice. 
These changes to the firewall should only need to occur once, and thus are not part of
the eups installation or setup. 

Please see $TS_SAL_DIR/SAL_User_Guide.pdf for instructions on the firewall setup (section 1 and most of section 2). 
If you wish to support running more than one simulation at a time, the port range specified in the manual needs 
to be extended to accommodate this. The lowest port number is always 7400. To figure out the highest port number necessary, 
use this formula:

```7413 + (14 * (Njobs - 1))```
